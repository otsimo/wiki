Besides from the challenges you face with due to autism, you may have noticed that there are also some other aspects that you can list as strengths or skills of your child.

Your child may not be clumsy, although it is a very common challenge. Furthermore, he/she may not be very good at math despite the fact that it is a common ability among individuals with autism.
