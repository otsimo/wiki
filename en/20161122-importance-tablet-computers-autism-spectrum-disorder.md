Similar research was conducted in Istanbul, Turkey in a rehabilitation center. Participants were picked after they were put to a special test. The application used in the research was designed by the research institution and focused on functional reading.

In this research, the application has 6 different stages. At the first stage, there are both visual and auditory hints. Here, sensing the voice and repeating the word skills are developed. At the second stage, visual and auditory hints are continued to be given. However, differently from the previous one, there are mixed letters and the study focuses on the child organizing the letters. At the third stage, there are no visual or auditory hints. Just like in second stage, the child is expected to organize mixed letters. At fourth stage, a visual pops up and the child is expected to find the word suitable for the visual in written form. The fifth stage includes the words only in written form and verbally pronounced words. And at the last stage, there is only name-visual matching.

If it is accepted that every person in society is different, autism awareness will also be accepted as a normal condition.
