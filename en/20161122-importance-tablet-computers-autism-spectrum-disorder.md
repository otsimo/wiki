# Importance of Tablet Computers in Autism Spectrum Disorder

Children with autism have limited perception. They need special education for this reason. The earlier the intervention and education is started, the better and easier of a chance individuals with autism have in increasing their learning capacity. Since they are different, an effort should be made to adapt these individuals with general social life.

There are various studies on this matter. Thanks to developing technologies, development of individuals with autism became much more easy. For instance, with some applications that can be installed on tablet computers, individuals with autism can both keep up with modern technology and get the education to adapt social life.

######  We Don't have to change autism but we have to accept it

The aim of this effort to reintroduce individual with autism to society is not to help them become like any other person in society. This would be a wrong choice. The main purpose should be accepting that these individuals are different and create an environment that would enable them to maintain their life comfortably.

######  Tablet Computers Increase Attention Span In a Significant Way

The most common symptom of autism spectrum disorder is the lack of attention focus. An application that can be downloaded on tablet computers is developed for this reason. With this application children learn to focus their attention. .Families get the chance to observe reactions of their children with this application.


Although an individual with autism has a lot in his mind, and is aware of many things, he cannot express himself since he struggles with communication. This way [these individuals](/typical-characteristics-autism-spectrum-disorder/) are introvert. It is hard to reach them. However, with devotion and effort it can be manageable.

###### Technology and Autism Education go hand-in-hand

An educational program for children with autism that is downloaded on tablet computers is found to be successful, according to a research from Canada. Similar research was conducted in Istanbul, Turkey in a rehabilitation center. Participants were picked after they were put to a special test. The application used in the research was designed by the research institution and focused on functional reading.

In this research, the application has 6 different stages. At the first stage, there are both visual and auditory hints. Here, sensing the voice and repeating the word skills are developed. At the second stage, visual and auditory hints are continued to be given. However, differently from the previous one, there are mixed letters and the study focuses on the child organizing the letters. At the third stage, there are no visual or auditory hints. Just like in second stage, the child is expected to organize mixed letters. At fourth stage, a visual pops up and the child is expected to find the word suitable for the visual in written form. The fifth stage includes the words only in written form and verbally pronounced words. And at the last stage, there is only name-visual matching.

In this study, words that will make education life easier of these special children were chosen and downloaded to the application. Afterwards, there were heartwarming results that parents observed and children experienced. Thanks to this application, children that participated in this study managed to exceed their limits on focusing their attention.

###### Autism is A Wide Spectrum

Every individual suffering from autism can utilize tablet applications like this. However, since development of every individual is different, exercises that will gradually develop them should be picked by special supervisors. Parents play a big role on this matter. Which words and visuals that the child is more sensitive to is best known by his parents. In this, parents will be the ones that guide the specialists.

It may be hard to reintegrate and individual with autism to social life. However, many successful individuals with autism in the society show how wrong it is to describe them as unhealthy individuals. These individuals gained great success in popular films and series today.  It should be remembered that individuals with autism are just different. If it is accepted that every person in society is different, autism awareness will also be accepted as a normal condition.
