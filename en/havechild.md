# Effects of Having a Child With Autism

Children are seen as new beginnings and blessings in every family. Families reorganize their lives according to their children and start to make decisions in accordance with this order. Children considerably affect parent&#39;s work, personal decisions and majority of their lives. Though these effects are restrictive, parents have already knew what they were going for.

A child with autism being born in a family causes the family and especially the parents to have profound stress and depression. The main reason for this profound stress and depression is that they think their children might not fit in with the society and its norms. It is almost inevitable for parents to feel unhappy and depressed as they see their children struggle with communication. Parents&#39; acceptance phase of the disorder and their children varies. Since this is not a common disorder in society, it is difficult for parents to accept the condition.

Besides from that, many researches show that mothers that have a child suffering from autism may show indications like isolating herself from social environments, difficulty in speaking and not being able to communicate properly. Parents, who think they are all by themselves to raise their children, have hard time accepting that their children are different from the others.

It is seen that parents who live with a child with autism are struggling with mental and financial depression. Parents, who worry about the future of their child, are constantly stressed about well-beings of their child that is suffering from autism after they pass away. They may have anxiety thinking that their children cannot have an independent life in the future. It is observed that they define this state as &quot;never-ending stress&quot;.

Feeling powerless on wanting to create the best future they can for their child may cause families experience an emotional breakdown. In this case, they may need psychological support. The biggest support for families to accept autism and start battle autism comes from their family friends and social environment.

Many families prefer having social support prior to psychological support. Families that are backed by their environment can interact with their children more quickly. After they overcome the acceptance phase, families try to improve lives of their children. Completing this step as soon as possible is crucial as this affects the acceptance of the child in the society in the future as an individual.

Family support is the most important element that adapts the child to life. The earlier the family accepts the fact that they have a child with autism, the sooner a step is taken for the child. This way children can adapt life and perform many activities their peers do.

It is also very important to enlighten other children in the family without autism. Once they are informed, they will easily accept their siblings and help their parents support them. These children, who should be provided with psychological support if needed, will make things easier for the parents.

According to the research, having a child with autism limits social activities parents take part in. That is why parents need social support. Parents with autistic children should get their loved ones&#39; help without hesitation and not debar from social interactions.
