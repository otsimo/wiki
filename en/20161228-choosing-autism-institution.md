Good institutions have experts that understand mental health of children. Each child with autism has different learning skills depending on their social and mental abilities. The institution should serve taking these differences into consideration.


## The education process should go hand-in-hand with their interests

The fields that children are learning should be suitable to their mental abilities. Since attention of autistic children is easily distracted, the classes should be designed accordingly. Also, their seating position should make them comfortable. [Children with autism spectrum disorder](/typical-characteristics-autism-spectrum-disorder/) do not like crowded environments, but they also need to be close enough for social development.

Concretion is important while teaching children with autism. Autistic children struggle with concreting some abstract concepts, depending on their mental functioning levels. Thus, during the education process, concretion types should be used in the institution. Senses are important in learning with concretion. For this reason, creating a symbol for every activity will be beneficial for guiding the child to these activities. It is also important to use sensory materials in classes.

A fine education institution should know social and mental capacity of every autistic child in their institution and provide special education accordingly. Which sense the child prefers while learning should be taken into consideration and every child should be treated depending on this. Children with autism may show problem behavior; making loud noises, constantly repeating a word or a move or showing little act of violence are pretty common. Public personnel should know how to deal these kinds of situations and have the knowledge to act towards removing the stress when children are under pressure.


It should be remembered that every child is different and each of their development should be under observation in the institution. Educational institutions can provide advanced level of education to children depending on this development. The educational method should be motivating for children. There is a motivation for every child that move them towards the wanted behavior; these motivations should be determined and when children show wanted behavior they should be rewarded.

The institution should prepare educational program and routines beforehand. Having a stable program would be convenient for children. If they know what to do in the next step they become more comfortable, and this helps them guess the order of the events and comprehend. Besides the education provided inside the institution, children's free time in which they play games are also important. The institution should pay attention for children to be not secluded. They should be encouraged to join group plays and cooperate.

Nothing can replace the family in education of children with autism; thus the institution that is chosen should always include and inform the family. It is better for children to not have their families with them in the educational institution, but the family should be informed about any state or development. Mutual communication between the institution and the family makes a significant contribution to the education of the child.

Many autistic children can become socially beneficial and independent, healthy individuals if they receive the necessary care and education. Thus, choosing an institution the child will receive education that meet the necessary criteria in line with what is stated above carries great importance for the child's social, academic and professional success in the future.
