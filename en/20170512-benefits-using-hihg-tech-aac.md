# What Are the Benefits of Using High-Tech AAC?

Augmentative and alternative communication systems are used as a communication gateway between your children who has difficulty in communication with their surroundings. AAC devices increase the ability to understand what is being said and used by the child to express what is going on their minds. Their benefits without a doubt show that how important it is to introduce high-tech AAC systems to children with autism.

AAC can be beneficial in every aspect of life. It can improve individual’s speech, language development, and literacy and increases the quality of work, school, and general life.

According to a research by Millar, Light, Schlosser (2006), 89% of the participants who used AAC improved their speech skills. PECS also has been proven to improve language development of children with autism.

Some researchers suggest that since AAC focuses on encouraging and providing communication, it reduces the psychological stress of individuals regarding the necessity of speaking and eases speech development process.

It is supported by a research (Koppenhaver, Coleman, Kalman, Yoder, 1991) that AAC also has a positive outcome in terms of language development and literacy, as it supports self-expression in social situations. Children with autism need help with developmental skills such as vocabulary, the length of sentence, syntax and pragmatic skills. AAC can be used as a guideline in this process.
